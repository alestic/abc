# abc (AI Bash Command)

## Synopsis

```
abc [OPTION]... DESCRIPTION...
```

## Description

abc uses a generative AI large language model to generate bash commands based on an English description provided by the user. The program takes the entire command line (excluding options) as the input description and returns bash command(s) that aim to accomplish the described task.

## Features

- Translates natural language descriptions into bash commands
- Interactive mode allows editing of generated commands before execution
- Configurable through a simple INI config file
- Supports multiple configuration profiles
- Provides verbose and debug output options

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Quick installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alestic/abc.git
cd abc
make build install
```

After installation, you'll see instructions for enabling the interactive mode.

### Using Interactive Mode

Once set up, you can use `abc` as you normally would. After generating a command, you'll be presented with an editable prompt containing the generated command. You can modify the command if needed before pressing Enter to execute it.

Example:

```
$ abc list all PDF files in the current directory
$ ls *.pdf
```

In this example, you'd see `ls *.pdf` in an editable prompt, allowing you to modify it before execution.

To use the original `abc` command without the interactive wrapper, you can use `command abc`.

## Options

- `--mode {prompt|run|norun}`: Specifies the mode of operation:
  - `prompt` (default): Prompts the user before running the command
  - `run`: Runs the command without prompting [CAUTION: Use carefully!]
  - `norun`: Displays the command without running or prompting
- `-c, --config CONFIGFILE`: Path to the primary configuration file. (Defaults to $ABC_CONFIG or "$HOME/.abc.conf")
- `-s, --config-section SECTION`: Specifies the configuration section to be used. (Defaults to "default")
- `--quiet`: Suppresses all output except for errors and the generated commands.
- `--verbose`: Provides detailed information about the program's execution.
- `--debug`: Provides debug information. Only use this when troubleshooting issues.
- `--version`: Displays the program version and exits.

## Environment

- `ABC_CONFIG`: Specifies the path to the configuration file. If not set, the script will look for a file at '~/.abc.conf'.

## Configuration

abc reads configurations from a config file in the INI file format. Each section should include key-value pairs.

Example configuration file:

```ini
[default]
api_key = your_api_key_here

[project-2]
api_key = another_api_key_here
default_options = --mode=norun
```

The program will attempt to read the config file from the first of these values provided:
1. `--config` command line option
2. $ABC_CONFIG environment variable
3. $HOME/.abc.conf

## Examples

To generate a bash command to list all PDF files in the current directory:

```
abc list all PDF files in the current directory
```

To use a specific project configuration and output the command without prompting:

```
abc -s project-2 --mode norun 'create a new directory named "test" and cd into it'
```

More complicated examples might take some trial and error to get the wording right:

```
abc find duplicate files. separate groups of file names by blank line
```

## Exit Status

- 0: Program executed successfully
- 1: An error occurred during execution

## CAVEATS

- LLMs do not always generate correct or expected output. Before running the commands generated by this tool, they should always be reviewed for appropriateness and for dangerous or unintended effects.

- This tool works in one environment on one Ubuntu release for one person. It may not work for you.

- There is a cost to using commercial LLM APIs. Review your spending regularly, and do not use this tool in an environment where it could be run automatically or excessively without human monitoring.

- The command `abc --help` does not currently work when using the interactive bash function.

## TODO

- Support multiple LLM models
- Support multiple LLM providers
- fix `abc --help` from bash function
- Smarter prompts
- "please think about it step-by-step within <thinking></thinking> tags"
- LLM evaluation of response
